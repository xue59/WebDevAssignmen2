        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <h3 class="hobby-name">Playing tennis</h3>        
        <p> 
            I started play tennis at high school. It’s a great lifetime sport. I have played for a few local armature tournament 
            and also joined a local tennis club with NTRP 3.5 division. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m looking forward to make new friends with playing tennis. 
            If you need someone to play tennis with, feel free to email me(email at end of the page).

            <h3 class="hobby-name">Nordic skiing and Alpine skiing</h3>
            <p>
                Skiing is probably one of my favorite sports now. I stared with cross-country Nordic skiing 
                and then move to downhill skiing. I enjoy the views on different mountain, 
                tryout new trails and terrains.

        <h3 class="hobby-name">Huge Fan of F1 Motor Racing</h3>
        <p>
            At beginning of the 2020 the pandemic brake out, while stay at home, I was attracted with the Netflix show Drive to Survive. From then, I started to follow up close regarding the F1 racing. During the race weekend I would gather around with group of friends to watch the race broadcast together. My favorite team is Redbull Honda Racing, and their driver Max won the World Champion in the 2021 season. One of my dreams is to watch a F1 racing on the track site. Hopefully, when the pandemic get over I would have an chance to do so.
