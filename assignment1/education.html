                <li>Course description:</li> 
                <li>CS5800 presents the mathematical techniques used for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. 
                    We will focus on algorithmic design paradigms and techniques for analyzing the correctness, time, and space complexity of algorithms. 
                    Topics may include asymptotic notation, recurrences, loop invariants, sorting and searching, advanced data structures, lower bounds, hashing, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, 
                    and NP-completeness.</li>

                <li>Course description:</li> 
                <li>The course reviews topics such as conceptual data modelling, relational data
                    model, relational query languages, relational database design and transaction processing and current technologies such as semantic web, parallel and
                    noSQL databases. It exposes the student to the fundamental concepts and
                    techniques in database use and development as well provides a foundation
                    for research in databases.

            <ul class="class-description-grade">
                <li>Course description:</li> 
                <li>Covers the principles of human-computer interaction and the design and evaluation of user interfaces. Topics include an overview of human information processing subsystems (perception, memory, attention, and problem solving); 
                    how the properties of these systems affect the design of user interfaces; the principles, guidelines, and specification languages for designing good user interfaces, with emphasis on tool kits and libraries of standard graphical user interface objects; and a variety of interface evaluation methodologies that can be used to measure the usability of software. Other topics may include World Wide Web design principles and tools, 
                    computer-supported cooperative work, multimodal and “next generation” interfaces, speech and natural language interfaces, and virtual reality interfaces. 
                    Course work includes both the creation and implementation of original user interface designs, and the evaluation of user interfaces created by others. Requires knowledge of C programming language/UNIX.

            <ul class="class-description-grade">
                <li>Course description:</li> 
                <li>Discusses Web development for sites that are dynamic, data driven, and interactive. Focuses on the software development issues of integrating multiple languages, assorted data technologies, and Web interaction. Considers ASP.NET, C#, HTTP, HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT, JavaScript, AJAX, RSS/Atom, SQL, and Web services. Each student must deploy individually designed Web experiments that illustrate the Web technologies and at least one major integrative Web site project. 
                    Students may work in teams with the permission of the instructor. Each student or team must also create extensive documentation of their goals, plans, design decisions, accomplishments, and user guidelines. All source files must be open and be automatically served by a sources server.
